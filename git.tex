% Since this a solution template for a generic talk, very little can
% be said about how it should be structured. However, the talk length
% of between 15min and 45min and the theme suggest that you stick to
% the following rules:

% - Exactly two or three sections (other than the summary).
% - At *most* three subsections per section.
% - Talk about 30s to 2min per frame. So there should be between about
%   15 and 30 frames, all told.

\begin{frame}{Software Configuration Management (SCM)}{Version Control}

Version control systems keep track of changes to source code.
Allows multiple people to edit a project in a predictable manner.

\end{frame}

\subsection{Source Configuration Management}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}[plain]{Software configuration Management (SCM)}{Source Configuration Management}


Software configuration management is the task of tracking and controlling changes in the software, part of the larger cross-disciplinary field of configuration management.\\
(\begin{scriptsize}\texttt{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software\_configuration\_management}                                                                                         \end{scriptsize})

Main open source software configuration management systems
\begin{itemize}
 \item 1982 RCS
 \item 1990 CVS
 \item 2000 Subversion
 \item 2005 Git/Mercurial
\end{itemize}

There are many proprietary ones but \texttt{Git} is now the most popular one by far.

All software should be under a version control system, if not, it ain't software!

\begin{frame}{Git}{Git sites}


It is easier to start with free hosting sites instead of maintaining your own server.

\begin{itemize}
 \item \alert{Github}: public repositories (as many as you want), but private ones are not free.
 \item \alert{Bitbucket}: allow us to keep private repositories limiting the number of collaborators.
\end{itemize}

It is typically used as central repository:
\begin{itemize}
 \item from which everyone pulls other people’s changes
 \item to which everyone pushes changes they have made
\end{itemize}

\section{Using Git}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Repository initialization and clonning}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Using Git}{Basic commands: Repository initialization}

When using Git for the first time:

\begin{verbatim}
git config --global user.email user@uah.es 
git config --global user.name  "Jane Doe"
\end{verbatim}

Initialization:

\begin{verbatim}
mkdir /path/to/your/project
cd /path/to/your/project
git init
git remote add origin https://<where>/<path>/<project.git>
git push -u origin --all # pushes up the repo and its refs for the first time
\end{verbatim} 

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Using Git}{Basic commands: Repository clonning}

To work with someone else’s repository, we first need to \emph{clone} it to get a
local copy.

\texttt{git clone <repo>}

E.g.:

\texttt{git clone https://github.com/danrodgar/gitSlides.git}

\begin{footnotesize}Note: once cloned, you can edit the repository as much as you want. No changes make their way back to the ‘central’ repository until you explicitly do so.
\end{footnotesize}
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Basic commands}


\begin{frame}[fragile]{Using Git}{Basic commands: tracking files}

Then, we can start tracking files. To do so, we need to \texttt{add}, \texttt{commit}, and \texttt{push} the file(s) that we want to track.


\begin{verbatim}
echo "A new file..." >> Readme.md
git add Readme.md
git commit -m 'Initial commit'
git push -u origin master
\end{verbatim}

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Using Git}{Basic commands: Pulling}

% \begin{columns}
% 	\column{.50\linewidth}
% 	\centering Centralized (SVN)\\\smallskip
% \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figs/centralized.png}
% 	\column{.50\linewidth}
% 	\centering Distributed (Git)\\\smallskip
% \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figs/distributed.png}
% \end{columns}
% To integrate all changes other people have made since you
% cloned/pulled: \texttt{git pull}

\begin{itemize}
 \item If you have made local changes you have to \\
 \texttt{git stash} \\
 before pulling, then \\
 \texttt{git stash pop} \\
 afterwards
 
 \item You can see which files you've modified with\\
  \texttt{git status}
 
 \item You can permanently remove your local changes by \\
 \texttt{git checkout <file>}
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Using Git}{Basic commands: Pushing}

\texttt{git add <file>} makes git track the file <file> 

Or to record all changes into a commit (notice the ‘.’):

\texttt{git commit .} 

\texttt{git push origin master} This pushes all new commits to the repository.


\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Merge and conflicts}
\begin{frame}{Using Git}{Merge and conflicts}

If two people both modify the same file, the first to push \emph{wins}.
The second person will have to pull and merge before pushing.

\begin{itemize}
 \item Changes in different parts of a file are automatically merged
 \item Changes in the same part of a file cause conflicts (between <<<
=== >>> ) and require the user to manually resolve them. Can
select either HEAD (your changes) or remote, or a mix of the two
\item Two merging cases: have / haven't committed
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Using Git}{Merge and conflicts: \texttt{diff}}

\texttt{diff -u <old file> <new file>} 

This command shows what changes you would need to apply to old file to change it into
new file.

Lines beginning with:
\begin{itemize}
 \item \texttt{- - -} or \texttt{+++} tell you the old / new filenames
 \item \texttt{@@} points to where within the file you are looking \\
       (i.e. a space) are lines that are unchanged
 \item \texttt{-} is a deleted line
 \item \texttt{+} is a newly added line
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Using Git}{Merge and conflicts: \texttt{diff} example}

\begin{scriptsize}
\begin{columns}
	\column{.50\linewidth}
	  \begin{verbatim}
	  #include <stdio.h> 
	  int main() {
	    printf("Hello World\n");
	  }
	  \end{verbatim}
	\column{.50\linewidth}
	  \begin{verbatim}
	    #include <stdio.h>
	    int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
	    printf("Hello World\n");
	    return 0;
	    }
	  \end{verbatim}
\end{columns}

Applying the \texttt{diff} command:
\begin{verbatim}
$ diff -u hello.c hello_new.c > hello.patch
\end{verbatim}

We get the following patch:
\begin{verbatim}
--- hello.c	2014-10-07 18:17:49.000000000 +0530
+++ hello_new.c	2014-10-07 18:17:54.000000000 +0530

 #include <stdio.h>

 	printf("Hello World\n");
+	return 0;
 }
\end{verbatim}
\end{scriptsize}


\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Using Git}{Merge and conflicts: Applying \texttt{diff} changes (patch command)}

After the \texttt{patch.diff} is created as:

\texttt{diff -u <old file> <new file> > file.patch }

We can apply it with the \texttt{patch} command:

\texttt{patch < file.patch}

Note that the \texttt{file.patch} knows the name of the file to be patched.

\begin{frame}{Using Git}{Commits}

\begin{itemize}
 \item Merge commits record where parallel development unified
 \item How does Git keep track of things when parallel development
happens?
\item Every commit has an ID (its hash), which is a 40 character SHA-1
hash based on the commit's content. Not guaranteed to be
unique; but it probably is
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Branches}
\begin{frame}{Using Git}{Branches}

Branches are used extensively (e.g. some like feature branches).

\begin{itemize}
 \item A repository (local and remote) can have explicit branches
 \item The default branch is called master
 \item \texttt{git branch <name>} creates branches
 \item \texttt{git checkout <branch name>} switch branches
 \item To merge branch X into Y, checkout Y and run git merge X
(i.e. you say “I want to merge another branch into me”)
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Advanced Git}
\begin{frame}{Using Git}{Advanced Git: Getting an old commit}

Sometimes you need to get an old file or discard some changes. With 

\begin{itemize}
 \item \texttt{git log} 
 \item \texttt{git log -- oneline}
\end{itemize}

we can check previous commits and select one with \texttt{checkout}, e.g.:
\begin{itemize}
 \item \texttt{git checkout c71d008}
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Using Git}{Advanced Git: Good practices}


Tipically changes are checked by someone other than their
author before being merged into master. This kind of \textbf{code review} is is naturally captured by pull requests in Git.

Learn on the job: the best way to learn it is by using it. However:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Best practice: regularly push and pull (at least daily, in general).
  \item Don't push half-baked changes or pull if you're in the middle of a task.
\end{itemize}
